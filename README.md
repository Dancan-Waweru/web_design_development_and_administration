#Learning HTML

This project is a personal journey to learn and practice HTML (HyperText Markup Language) â€” the basic building block of all web pages.

##ðŸŒ± Goal

To understand how web pages are structured and how to use HTML to organize and present content effectively.

ðŸ“š ##What Iâ€™m Learning

##The structure of an HTML document

 (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>)

Common tags like:

Headings (<h1> to <h6>)

Paragraphs (<p>)

Links (<a>)

Images (<img>)

Lists (<ul>, <ol>, <li>)

Tables (<table>, <tr>, <td>)

Forms (<form>, <input>, <button>)

Adding comments and spacing for better readability

How to make pages more meaningful using semantic tags (<header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>)

##ðŸ§  Why HTML

Learning HTML is the first step toward becoming a web developer.
It teaches how browsers read and display content â€” which makes it easier to later learn CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks.
